## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Defence

## Idea
The goal is to develop a web-based solution that simulates a realistic interview process for recruitment, ensuring an unbiased and objective evaluation of both questions and candidate responses. This process must align with specific areas of expertise and match the candidate’s qualifications and the job requirements. The key challenge lies in providing a platform that:

Facilitates structured interviews with relevant, domain-specific questions.
Evaluates the relevance of questions based on the applicant’s area of expertise.
Evaluates the candidate’s responses for their relevance to the asked questions.
Generates a quantifiable score for the entire interview process, which can then be used for decision-making.
